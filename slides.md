# Interruptions

Research has shown it can take 10-15 minutes to get back into the "zone" after interruption

# Context Switching

Research has shown that developers who work on **2-3** projects spend on average **17%** of their effort context switching.

# Short Cycle Times

# Mathemtical Evidence

Applying queue theory` to WIP

---

template: solo
# Little's Law

$$Cycle Time=\frac{WIP}{Throughput}$$

Throughput - How many tasks completed in a timeframe

Directly proportional

---

# Example

$$Cycle Time\,=\frac{10\,\mathrm{tasks}}{10\,\mathrm{\left.\mathrm{tasks}\middle/\mathrm{week}\right.}}=1\,\mathrm{week}$$

# Bottlenecks

Waiting on: PR Review, Deployment, Testing

# Filling spare capacity with more WIP

$$Cycle Time\,=\frac{15\,\mathrm{tasks}}{10\,\mathrm{\left.\mathrm{tasks}\middle/\mathrm{week}\right.}}=1.5\,\mathrm{weeks}$$

# Next Time You are Blocked - Waiting for a Review

What should you do?

1. ~~Start something new?~~

2. Review Code. If your team has none, review another team's code

3. Re-review your own code

4. Review tech specs

5. Check tickets needing testing in dev/prod

6. Check recent monitors and test failures

7. Test some recent things on dev/prod related to team work

8. ...
