# What is the problem?

# Interruptions

Research has shown it can take 10-15 minutes to get back into the "zone" after interruption

# Context Switching

Research has shown that developers who work on **2-3** projects spend on average **17%** of their effort context switching.

# Cycle Time

Total calendar time taken to do a task

Something we track and try to improve

Deliver value earlier / Fast feedback loops (to customers, between teams)

# Little's Law

$$Cycle Time=\frac{WIP}{Throughput}$$

Throughput - How many tasks completed in a timeframe
Directly proportional

---

# Example

$$Cycle Time\,=\frac{10\,\mathrm{tasks}}{10\,\mathrm{\left.\mathrm{tasks}\middle/\mathrm{week}\right.}}=1\,\mathrm{week}$$

# Filling spare capacity with more WIP

$$Cycle Time\,=\frac{15\,\mathrm{tasks}}{10\,\mathrm{\left.\mathrm{tasks}\middle/\mathrm{week}\right.}}=1.5\,\mathrm{weeks}$$

# How to Reduce Cycle Time?

Don't increase WIP

Remove bottlenecks, increase throughput

# Waiting for a Review

What should you do?

1. ~~Start something new?~~

2. Review Code. If your team has none, review another team's code

3. Review tech specs

4. Check tickets needing testing in dev/prod

5. Check recent monitors and test failures

6. Test some recent things on dev/prod related to team work

7. ...
